Exercise 1: Warming Up!
-----------------------

- Step 1:
Already completed during warmup.

- Step 2:
Opened design.pd.

- Step 3:
Exported Player diagram as png. (See player-design.png).

- Step 4:
Added descriptionfor HandlePercept plan.

- Step 5:
Generated JACK code.

- Step 6:
Verified that sources were present and up to date.

- Step 7:
Added to Main.java (line 57):

	System.setProperty("java.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort", "true");

Removed from Makefile (line 17):

	-DJAVACARGS="-target 1.5"

To enabled error free compilation and exectuion under Java 1.7.
As advised I will change to JDK 1.6.

- Summary:
I have learned basic navigation of a PDT project, and how to generate JACK code
and then compile that to Java code. I have also learned how to export diagrams
as PNG files for documentation.
