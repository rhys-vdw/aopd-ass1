Exercise 1: Warming Up!
-----------------------

- Step 1:
Already completed during warmup.

- Step 2:
Opened design.pd.

- Step 3:
Exported Player diagram as png. (See player-design.png).

- Step 4:
Added descriptionfor HandlePercept plan.

- Step 5:
Generated JACK code.

- Step 6:
Verified that sources were present and up to date.

- Step 7:
Added to Main.java (line 57):

	System.setProperty("java.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort", "true");

Removed from Makefile (line 17):

	-DJAVACARGS="-target 1.5"

To enabled error free compilation and exectuion under Java 1.7.
As advised I will change to JDK 1.6.

- Summary:
I have learned basic navigation of a PDT project, and how to generate JACK code
and then compile that to Java code. I have also learned how to export diagrams
as PNG files for documentation.

Exercise 2: Knowing where we are
--------------------------------

- Step 1:
Did not add console output, as a similar output was already present in
HandlePercept.plan (line 114):

    consoleIface.showConsoleDebug("A request-action event for step-id " + step
        + "-" + id + " states that " + getAgent().name() +
        " is currently at location " + currentPos.toString() + " with " + items
        + " pieces of gold");

Completing step would simply add redundant output for event. I have not included
the program output as it would be indistinguishable from 'trace1-7.txt'.

- Step 2:
Created new beliefset for Player.
'CurrentPosition' is #private with fields int posX, int posY.

- Step 3:
Generated code successfully.

- Step 4:
Added two queries to CurrentPosition.bel (line 26, just after PDT Design Block":

    #index query get(logical int posX, logical int posY);
    #index query check(int posX, int posY);

These queries allow the current position to be retrieved (get) or checked
against supplies integer values (check). The 'logical' arguments on get are
output variables.

- Step 5:
a: Added link from GamePlaying to bel_currentPosition in Player page in Detailed
Design. This is because current position is updated by the game.

Then within this GamePlaying capability, linked from HandlePercept to
bel_currentPosition.

b: Generate JACK code. Observed new #modifies statement in HandlePercept.plan
(line 39).

        #modifies data CurrentPosition bel_currentPosition_dat;
