Exercise 1: Warming Up!
-----------------------

- Step 1:
Already completed during warmup.

- Step 2:
Opened design.pd.

- Step 3:
Exported Player diagram as png. (See player-design.png).

- Step 4:
Added descriptionfor HandlePercept plan.

- Step 5:
Generated JACK code.

- Step 6:
Verified that sources were present and up to date.

- Step 7:
Added to Main.java (line 57):

	System.setProperty("java.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort", "true");

Removed from Makefile (line 17):

	-DJAVACARGS="-target 1.5"

To enabled error free compilation and exectuion under Java 1.7.
As advised I will change to JDK 1.6.

- Summary:
I have learned basic navigation of a PDT project, and how to generate JACK code
and then compile that to Java code. I have also learned how to export diagrams
as PNG files for documentation.

Exercise 2: Knowing where we are
--------------------------------

- Step 1:
Did not add console output, as a similar output was already present in
HandlePercept.plan (line 114):

    consoleIface.showConsoleDebug("A request-action event for step-id " + step
        + "-" + id + " states that " + getAgent().name() +
        " is currently at location " + currentPos.toString() + " with " + items
        + " pieces of gold");

Completing step would simply add redundant output for event. I have not included
the program output as it would be indistinguishable from 'trace1-7.txt'.

- Step 2:
Created new beliefset 'CurrentPosition' for Player.
Fields: int posX, int posY.
Neither fields are keys, as only one position can be "current" for an agent.
The beliefset is #private because each Player has its own unique current
position in the game.


- Step 3:
Generated code successfully.

- Step 4:
Added two queries to CurrentPosition.bel (line 26, just after PDT Design Block):

    #linear query get(logical int posX, logical int posY);
    #linear query check(int posX, int posY);

These queries allow the current position to be retrieved (get) or checked
against supplies integer values (check). The 'logical' arguments on get are
output variables.

As the operation is on a set of exactly one tuple, the queries are linear for
efficiency.

- Step 5:

a: Added link from GamePlaying to bel_currentPosition in Player page in Detailed
Design. This is because current position is updated by the game.

Then within this GamePlaying capability, linked from HandlePercept to
bel_currentPosition.

b: Generate JACK code. Observed new #modifies statement in HandlePercept.plan
(line 39).

        #modifies data CurrentPosition bel_currentPosition_dat;

c. Added code to HandlePercept.plan to update current position beliefset
(line 126):

    // Update beliefset with the current position of the agent
    bel_currentPosition_dat.add(posX, posY);

PROBLEMS:
The first time I attempted this step I added the link from GamePlaying to
bel_currentPosition and then removed it before continuin. This did not remove
bel_currentPosition from within the GamePlaying capability. PDT stopped
working and I had to start again.

- Step 6:
Modify plan ConsoleBeliefPrinting to print out the agent's believed current position.

Added connection from bel_currentPosition to InfoReporting in Player's
GamePlaying capability.

Set bel_currentPosition's modifier to #imports in the InfoReporting diagram.
Added link from bel_currentPosition to ConsoleBeliefPrinting.

Added these lines to the end of body in ConsoleBeliefPrinting.plan (line 85):

        logical int $posX, $posY;
        bel_currentPosition_dat.get($posX, $posY);
        consoleIface.showConsoleDebug("Agent " + getAgent().getName() +
            " believes it is currently at location (" + $posX + "," + $posY +
            ")");

The output can be seen when the program runs (output edited for readability):

[[player6@%portal]] A request-action event for step-id 19-20 states that
                    player6@%portal is currently at location (5, 5) with 0
                    pieces of gold
[[player6@%portal]] Current ID step: 20
[[player6@%portal]] Number of cells believed empty of obstacles: 32
[[player6@%portal]] Number of believed obstructed cells: 2
[[player6@%portal]] Agent player6@%portal believes it is currently at location
                    (5,5)                           <------- THIS THE NEW OUTPUT
[[player6@%portal]] I will move randomly to this dir: down
[[player6@%portal]] I sent CLIMA action *down* for execution with id 20

<Action
    :type  "down"
    :param  "player6@%portal"
    :id  "20"
>

(full output available in trace2-4.txt)

- Summary:
In this exercise I have learned how to:
 - display debug output to console.
 - create a new beliefset.
 - add and retrieve data from a beliefset.
 - interpret and extend the relationship between beliefs and plans in PDT.
 - use version control to prevent losing my progress :)

Exercise 3: Keeping track of gold pieces
----------------------------------------

- Step 1:
CellEmpty is updated by plan UpdateCellsAround. This plan takes an event
'EUpdateBelief' containing a grid coordinate and a list of contents from
its surrounding cells.

At the moment HandlePercept is the only source of EUpdateBelief events, so the
belief updates could be performed within HandlePercept without any change in
behaviour. However, it makes sense to decouple these because later we would
like the agents to benefit from each other's perception.

More specifically, an agent will send an EUpdateBelief to each of its team
mates so that they may know positions of gold, barriers, opponents etc.
When they receive it they will use their "UpdateCellsAround" plan.

- Step 2:
Created data object "bel_goldAt" in Detailed Design -> Player. Modifer is
"#private" because each agent has its own record of perception (for now).

Added data type:
name: GoldAt
fields: int xCoord, int yCoord (both fields are keys, because a different value
must be stored for every unique cell)

- Added connection FROM GamePlaying TO bel_goldAt.

- Within GamePlaying:
  - Added connection FROM UpdateCellsAround TO bel_goldAt.
  - Set modifier of bel_goldAt to #imports.
  - Added connection FROM bel_goldAt TO InfoReporting (for debugging changes).

- Generated Jack successfully!

- Changed belief GoldAt's superclass to OpenWorld (agents will not know the
status of every cell in the game)
